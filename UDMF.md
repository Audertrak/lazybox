Universal Data Morphing Framework (UDMF)**

**Postulate 1:** All structured data can be represented as a Generalized Labeled Property Graph (GLPG).
**Postulate 2:** Any transformation between structured data formats can be modeled as a sequence of operations on their GLPG representations.

**Deliverables (Proofs & Definitions):**

1.  **Formal Definition of the Generalized Labeled Property Graph (GLPG):**
    *   A tuple \(G = (N, E, \Sigma_N, \Sigma_E, K, V, \lambda_N, \lambda_E, \text{src}, \text{tgt}, \pi_N, \pi_E)\) defining nodes, edges, labels, properties, and their interrelations.
    *   Definition of GLPG Schemas (Meta-GLPGs) for type checking and constraint enforcement.

2.  **Universal Canonicality of GLPG (Demonstrated Mappings):**
    *   Fundamental Data Structures (Arrays, Lists, Maps, Trees) to GLPG.
    *   HTML Document Object Model (DOM) to GLPG.
    *   Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to GLPG.
    *   Compiler Intermediate Representations (CFG, DFG, SoN) to GLPG.
    *   Relational Database Schemas and Data to GLPG.
    *   Database Normalization (1NF-BCNF) as GLPG structural properties and transformations.

3.  **Formal Definition of the Universal Data Morphing Framework (UDMF) Process:**
    *   **Stage 1: Canonical Ingestion:** \(S_{source} \rightarrow G_{GLPG}\) (Mapping source primitives to GLPG).
    *   **Stage 2: Semantic Enrichment:** \(G_{GLPG} \rightarrow G'_{GLPG}\) (Applying schemas, linking ontologies, inferring relations).
    *   **Stage 3: Transformation:** \(G'_{GLPG} \xrightarrow{\text{rules/ops}} G''_{GLPG}\) (Applying graph rewriting or algorithmic operations).
    *   **Stage 4: Serialization:** \(G''_{GLPG} \rightarrow S_{target}\) (Mapping GLPG to target primitives).

4.  **Theory of GLPG Transformations:**
    *   Formalisms: Graph Rewriting Systems (e.g., DPO), Attributed Graph Grammars.
    *   Properties: Termination, Confluence, Expressiveness.
    *   Conceptualization of Transformation Languages.

5.  **Complexity Analysis:**
    *   Computational complexity of GLPG operations (CRUD, query, matching).
    *   Performance considerations for the UDMF pipeline stages.

6.  **Illustrative Case Studies (Proof-of-Concept Application):**
    *   Data Integration.
    *   Legacy System Modernization.
    *   Code Translation (subset).
    *   Semantic Web Data Exchange.
    *   Dataset Normalization.

**Conclusion:** The UDMF, centered on the GLPG, provides a formally defined, universal framework for modeling and transforming any structured data into any other structured data format.
